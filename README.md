# Hack The Future 2023 - Code for Nature

This is a [React](https://react.dev) project bootstrapped in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) that contains some code to get started with, but feel free to start your own React project in another framework.

## How to get started?

### 1. Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Your web app is now live at http://localhost:5173! ðŸŽ‰

## What is included?

### Types

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), but don't worry if you're not familiar with TypeScript: it's just JavaScript with typing. (like Java and .NET)

Like mentioned before, feel free to start your own React project without TypeScript if you don't want to use TypeScript.

`types.ts` contains the types for the API you will be using.

### Constants

`constants.ts` contains the URLs of the API you will be using.

### Packages

We recommend you to use the following packages, which is why we have installed them by default, but feel free to use other packages instead:

- [`react-leaflet`](https://react-leaflet.js.org) for creating a map

## Tips

- Use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for retrieving data from the API
